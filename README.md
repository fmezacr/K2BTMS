# K2BTMS (K2 B Type Massive Stars) 

The NASA Kepler mission operated for 4 years in space, and observed one
field uninterruptedly, providing very high precision (aprox 1 ppm) light curves
for around 160 000 stars with a high focus on the exploration of exoplanets.
However, Kepler lost two of its reaction wheels in 2014, and since then, it is
bound to observe along the Ecliptic Plane (EP), after some adjustment Kepler
was born as a new mission called K2. Therefore, the pointing accuracy of
K2 is poorer than the nominal Kepler mission (aprox 50 ppm), and the observing
duration per each field is limited to aprox 80 days which limits the variability
frequency resolution. Still, K2 has opened up a new research window in
stellar astrophysics by observing more massive O- and B-type stars around
the galactic plane. Since 2014, the Institute of Astronomy in KU Leuven
in Belgium coordinated data acquisition of several O-type and B-type stars
(with masses exceeding aprox 3 M_sun) spread over different campaigns. The raw
light curves are publically available, and ready to be analyzed, however, none
of these targets are properly characterized based on their variability class.
In this thesis, we initiate an ambitious project to classify the stars based
on their given light curves, and the frequency distributions in the Fourier
space. The target stars are classified as slowly pulsating B stars (SPB), beta
Cephei stars ( Cep), and hybrid SPB/beta Cep candidates. There exist
other sources of variability which we are currently unable to associate as
classical pulsators, our sample set was composed by 495 K2 stars from observation
campaigns 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. The results of our analysis are compiled
as a journal which includes all steps of our analysis for the entire sample.
The journal will be available through an external URL.
